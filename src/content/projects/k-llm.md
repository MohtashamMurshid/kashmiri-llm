# Kashmiri Heritage LLM (K-LLM)

## A Community-Owned Language Model
The Kashmiri Heritage LLM (K-LLM) is a groundbreaking initiative to develop a large language model specifically trained on the Kashmiri language (Koshur), its dialects, and the region's vast cultural repository. Unlike generic models, K-LLM is designed to understand the nuances of Kashmiri poetry, folklore, and historical context.

### Objectives
- **Preserve Language**: Train on a diverse corpus of Kashmiri text, including Nastaliq and Sharada scripts.
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Embed knowledge of Kashmiri traditions, rituals, and social norms.
- **Accessibility**: Provide high-quality translation between Kashmiri and major global languages.

### Key Features
- **Bilingual Translation**: Seamless switching between Kashmiri and English.
- **Cultural Q&A**: Ask questions about "Wanvun" (wedding songs), "Bhand Pather" (folk theatre), or the history of the Martand Sun Temple.
- **Creative Writing**: Generate poetry in the style of Lal Ded or Habba Khatoon.

### Data Sources
The model is trained on:
1.  **Oral Histories**: Transcribed recordings from elders.
2.  **Manuscripts**: Digitized texts from the digitization project.
3.  **Literature**: Classic and contemporary Kashmiri literature.

### Impact
This project ensures that the Kashmiri language does not just survive but thrives in the digital age, providing a foundation for future apps, educational tools, and research.
