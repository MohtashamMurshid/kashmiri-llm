# Kashmiri Heritage Geo-Map

## Mapping the Landscape of Memory
The Kashmiri Heritage Geo-Map is a GIS-based project that connects the physical landscape of Kashmir with its cultural and historical layers. It goes beyond simple geography to map the "lived heritage" of the region.

### Objectives
- **Spatial Documentation**: Map heritage sites, shrines (Ziarats), temples, and old markets.
- **Historical Layers**: Visualize how the region has changed over centuries, tracing old trade routes like the Silk Road connections.
- **Cultural Context**: Link geographical locations to the stories, crafts, and events associated with them.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Interface**: A 3D map allowing users to explore the valley virtually.
- **Time Slider**: View the map at different points in history.
- **Data Layers**: Toggle layers for "Craft Clusters," "Sufi Shrines," "Ancient Capitals," and "Water Bodies."
- **Multimedia Integration**: Click on a location to see photos, videos, and hear oral histories related to that spot.

### Impact
This tool is vital for:
- **Tourism**: Guiding travelers to culturally significant sites.
- **Urban Planning**: Helping policymakers understand heritage zones.
- **Research**: Providing spatial data for historical analysis.
