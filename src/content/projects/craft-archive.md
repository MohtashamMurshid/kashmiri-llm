# Kashmiri Art & Craft AI Archive

## Preserving the Hands of Heritage
Kashmir is world-renowned for its exquisite craftsmanship, from the intricate needlework of Sozni to the delicate painting of Papier Mâché. The Kashmiri Art & Craft AI Archive is a digital repository and AI analysis tool designed to document, categorize, and preserve these artistic traditions.

### Objectives
- **Digital Preservation**: Create high-resolution digital twins of rare and endangered craft items.
- **Motif Recognition**: Train AI to identify and categorize specific motifs (e.g., Chinar leaf, Paisley/Buta) and their historical significance.
- **Design Evolution**: Trace the evolution of styles over centuries.

### Key Features
- **Visual Database**: A searchable gallery of thousands of craft items.
- **AI Analysis**: Tools for artisans to analyze patterns and generate new designs inspired by tradition.
- **Authentication**: AI-assisted verification of authentic Kashmiri handicrafts to combat counterfeiting.

### Focus Areas
- **Pashmina & Shahtoosh**: Weaving techniques and embroidery patterns.
- **Papier Mâché (Naqashi)**: Floral and geometric designs.
- **Wood Carving (Pinjra Kari)**: Geometric lattice work found in architecture.
- **Carpet Weaving (Qaleen)**: Traditional Persian-influenced designs.

### Impact
By documenting these crafts, we not only preserve the visual history but also support the economic livelihood of artisans by validating the authenticity and value of their work.
