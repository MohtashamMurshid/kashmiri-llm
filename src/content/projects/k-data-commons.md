# The Kashmiri Data Commons (K-Data Commons) Digital Repository

## Project Vision
To create a trusted, ethical, and fully open-source data portal that centralizes, standardizes, and publishes all Kashmiri cultural and linguistic datasets generated by this initiative for global AI research and public use.

### Objectives
- **Standardization & Cleaning**: Take the raw outputs (transcriptions, images, translations, text) from Projects 1–6 and format them into industry-standard, clean, and well-documented datasets (e.g., JSON, CSV, Hugging Face format).
- **Licensing & Governance**: Implement a community-driven licensing framework (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA, or a custom ethical license) that permits non-extractive, non-commercial use for research, while protecting the data from commercial misuse.
- **API & Open Access**: Develop a public-facing API and web portal for researchers, developers, and students to easily search, filter, and download datasets.
- **Bias Documentation**: Document the collection methodology and potential sources of bias in each dataset (e.g., dialect focus, gender ratio in oral histories) to promote responsible AI development.

### Outputs
- **The Zunn-Daan Public Portal**: A functional, free-to-access, central website for dataset discovery.
- **Seven Standardized Datasets**: Publishing the cleaned data from each project (Text Corpus, Speech Corpus, Craft Image Library, etc.).
- **Standardized Metadata**: Complete documentation for all datasets following best practices (like the Data Cards or Model Cards framework).
