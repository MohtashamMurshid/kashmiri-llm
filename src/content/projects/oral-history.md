# Kashmiri Oral History & Memory Project

## A Living Archive of Voices
In a region that has seen significant change and displacement, oral history is a fragile yet vital repository of truth. The Kashmiri Oral History & Memory Project uses AI to record, transcribe, and organize the spoken memories of the people.

### Objectives
- **Record Voices**: Collect stories from elders, artisans, and everyday individuals across the valley and the diaspora.
- **Preserve Dialects**: Document endangered dialects like Poguli, Kishtwari, and Gujri.
- **Thematic Organization**: Curate stories around themes like festivals, weddings, migration, and daily life in the past.

### Key Features
- **AI Transcription**: Automated transcription and translation of audio recordings.
- **Semantic Search**: Search the archive not just by keywords, but by concepts (e.g., "childhood games," "harvest rituals").
- **Community Uploads**: A platform for families to upload their own recordings of grandparents.

### Impact
This project ensures that the personal histories of Kashmiris are not lost. It creates a "people's history" that complements official records, providing a rich, emotional, and human perspective on the region's past.
