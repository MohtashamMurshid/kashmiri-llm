# Manuscript & Document Digitization AI

## Unlocking the Written Legacy
Kashmir has a deep literary tradition spanning centuries, written in Sharada, Persian, and Nastaliq scripts. Much of this is locked away in fragile manuscripts. This project aims to digitize and make this knowledge accessible.

### Objectives
- **Digitization**: High-resolution scanning of rare books, poetry compilations, and historical documents.
- **OCR Development**: Build Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems specifically for handwritten Nastaliq and the ancient Sharada script.
- **Translation**: Make these texts available in English and modern Kashmiri.

### Key Features
- **Open Digital Library**: A free, online library of digitized manuscripts.
- **Searchable Text**: Unlike simple image scans, our AI makes the content searchable.
- **Crowdsourced Annotation**: Scholars and volunteers can help annotate and correct OCR outputs.

### Impact
This project democratizes access to knowledge that was previously available only to a few scholars. It feeds directly into the K-LLM, ensuring the AI model is grounded in authentic historical texts.
